DESCRIPTION: 

There are no explanations. You have to create the code that gives the following results in Python, Ruby, and Haskell:

one_two_three(0) == [0, 0]
one_two_three(1) == [1, 1]
one_two_three(2) == [2, 11]
one_two_three(3) == [3, 111]
one_two_three(19) == [991, 1111111111111111111]
And it should give the following results in Javascript, Scala, D, Go, and Rust:

oneTwoThree(0) == ['0', '0']
oneTwoThree(1) == ['1', '1']
oneTwoThree(3) == ['3', '111']
oneTwoThree(19) == ['991', '1111111111111111111']
In C, the results are to be assigned to seperate pointers.

*/

// SOLUTION:

function oneTwoThree(n) {
  const sum =
    n <= 9
      ? String(n)
      : `${'9'.repeat(Math.floor(n / 9))}${String(n % 9 || '')}`;

  return [sum, '1'.repeat(n) || '0'];
}
